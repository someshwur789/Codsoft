# Codsoft
Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

# Project
1. Titanic Survival Prediction:
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict Passenger Survival. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and
to predict survival probabilities.

     The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and
whether or not they survived.

2. Iris Flower Classification:
The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different
species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

     In this Project, I have used a Iris Dataset to develop a model that can classify Iris flowers into Different Species Based on their Sepal_length, width,
Petal_length, width. This Dataset is widely used for introductory Classification tasks.

3. Sales Prediction using python:
This project focuses on predicting sales for a business. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive
model to forecast future sales.

     In this Project, I have used a Sales Dataset to develop a model that can classify Sales of the TV, Radio, Newspaper.
